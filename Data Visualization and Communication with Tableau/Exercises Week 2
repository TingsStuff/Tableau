## Practice Exercises for Week 2

Before starting to address analysis questions, it’s a good idea to get a feel for what our
data look like. To get started, I suggest you use the Row and Column shelves and the
Marks Card in the Tableau workspace to determine:

**Excercise 1**
1) How many unique dogs are in the data set (indicated by the number of unique
entries in Dog ID)?
2) How many unique (human) users are in the data set (indicated by the number of
unique entries in User ID)?

* Solution for Excercise 1
1. drag Dog ID, User ID into Rows. 
2. Measure-> Count(Distinct)


* As a discussion point, what does it mean if the number of unique User IDs is different
from the number of unique Dog IDs?
• A user may have multiple dogs

Before addressing primary analysis questions,examine whether there are
questionable values in your key fields that may be mistakes or outliers.

First, place Country in the Rows shelf as a dimension to see what countries are represented
in our data set. If you turn that Country pill into a measure, you can aggregate it by Count
(Distinct) to see how many countries there are in total.
